 Poetry Day and also inline with Flowers Day. I just want to you to know Francine Davee G. Beseril that when I first saw you it feels like a warmth hug from behind and grasping my very soul like I'm going to die from your love but, unfortunately I can't send to you because you like someone else and I want to respect it and not destroy your peace due to my witty link. 3-21-2025
